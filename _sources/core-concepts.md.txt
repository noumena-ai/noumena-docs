# TQL Terminology and Data Processing Model

## TimeSeries

## Timelines
TQL uses a unique structure to represent raw time series data called the **Timeline**.  A Timeline is simply an ordered sequence of events belonging to a unique key (i.e. user_id).   Events may also originate from more than one source.  For example, a typically online advertising funnel use case, a user's Timeline might be the combination of a stream of ad opportunities, treatments (i.e. impressions), and conversion activity such as product-views, add-to-carts, and purchases.  

Roughly, construction of these timelines correspond to the following SQL pseudocode:
```
SELECT 
  o.*, t.*, c.*,
  FROM opportunities o
  LEFT OUTER JOIN treatments t
  LEFT OUTER JOIN conversions c
 GROUP BY user_id
 ORDER GROUPED VALUES BY timestamp
 ```
TQL queries process each timeline as a unit, emitting a row for each event in the timeline (subject to `where()` and `limit()` clauses, among other things):

For example, If your input data has 10 timelines with 5 events each, a TQL query with no where clauses or limits will emit a 50 row dataset, one for each event.
